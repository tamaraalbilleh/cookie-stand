## Reflections and Comments
* How did this go, overall?
good , at first I wasn't sure how to start ,but when I did one thing lead to the other until it was all finished .

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
I have no question 

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
it took approximately like 3-4 hours, and it'd take way more
